# Intro to Machine Learning

## Supervised vs Unsupervised

- Supervised: Input to output (x -> y) mapping. The most common form of ML
  - Regression: __Predicts Numbers__ A type of supervised ML that aims to predict a numerical value based on on an infinte number of possibilites.
  - Classification: __Predicts Categories__ Another tyoe of supervised ML that predicts categories for a small number of possibilites. Class === Category
- Unsupervised: Data isn't associated with any outputs, but instead finds patterns or other interesting characteristics of the data and determines results accordingly, used for clustering data

## Regression Model

- Linear Regression: "Fitting data to a straight line", you know what a linear regression is
- Training Set: The Data used to train the model
  - Notation: 

    $x$: "input" or "feature" variable
    
    $y$: "output" or "target" variable

    $m$: number of training examples

    $(x,y)$: a single training example

    $(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})$: $i^{th}$ training example
